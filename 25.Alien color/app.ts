// Question 25
// Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable
//  called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.

// Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.

// Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)

// Alien Colors #2: Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 25, and write an if-else chain

// • If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.

// • If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.

// • Write one version of this program that runs the if block and another that runs the else block.

// • If the alien is red, print a message that the player earned 15 points.

// • Write three versions of this program, making sure each message is printed for the appropriate color alien.
